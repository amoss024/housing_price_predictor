To set up the repo and run the application on your local machine, you must follow these series of steps:

1. create a gitHub account
2. navigate to the original repository and fork it
3. clone the repository on your local machine by copying the url and using these key words on git Bash: git clone <url>
4. navigate to the directory cloned locally by using the key word "cd" and then the name of the repository to change directory 
5. add a branch and checkout (focus on that branch) it out by using "git checkout -b" + name of branch you want to create

--> this will not only set up the repo, it will also clone it locally and lastly to open it on vs code use the key words "code ." and a window will open automatically
